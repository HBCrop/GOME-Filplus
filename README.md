## Client Diligence

To ensure collaboration with legitimate enterprise clients and establish initial trust, GOME Fil+ implements the following verification and trust-building mechanisms:

- **KYC/KYB Verification**: All clients must complete comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) verification, including identity and business background checks.
- **Required Documentation**:
  - Government-issued identification (for individuals).
  - Business registration certificate.
  - Articles of incorporation.
  - Business authorization letter (signed and stamped).
- **Project Background Assessment**: We evaluate client project legitimacy by reviewing:
  - Official website.
  - GitHub repositories.
  - Whitepapers or relevant documentation.
  - Online presence and credibility.

**Sybil Attack Mitigation**:
To prevent Sybil attacks and fake identities:

- We utilize third-party KYC/KYB providers, such as Toggle, for identity verification, which includes:
  - Face ID checks.
  - Government-issued ID verification.
  - Slack and GitHub account linkage.
- Clients must use unique, verifiable business identities. Duplicate or unrelated shell companies will be rejected.
- All personal and sensitive data is used exclusively for verification purposes and will not be shared or repurposed.

**Auditable Evidence for Governance**:
To ensure transparency and auditability for the Filecoin Governance Team, we maintain and submit:

- Comprehensive KYC/KYB reports for each client.
- CID sampling logs and download proofs using Lotus tools.
- Deal proofs, including verified dealIDs, pieceCIDs, data sizes, and sealing status.
- Historical client behavior and DataCap usage records.
- Geographic and industry metadata for each client and deal.

All information is periodically published (with sensitive data redacted) in our GitHub bookkeeping repository: [https://github.com/HBCrop/GOME-Filplus](https://github.com/HBCrop/GOME-Filplus).

## Description of Data Diligence

To verify that client data complies with the Filecoin Plus program scope and adheres to legal and regulatory requirements, GOME Fil+ implements the following data diligence processes:

- **Data Legality and Compliance**:
  - **Legal Data Source**: We accept only data owned by the client or explicitly authorized for storage. Storing unauthorized sensitive or infringing data is strictly prohibited.
  - **Data Privacy Protection**: For data containing personally identifiable information (PII), compliance with GDPR, China Cybersecurity Law, and other applicable privacy regulations is mandatory.
  - **Data Security Review**: We ensure data is free of malware, viruses, or content that could compromise the storage network’s security.

- **Data Geographic and Legal Compliance**:
  - **Data Residency Restrictions**: Data storage complies with the legal requirements of the client’s and business’s jurisdictions, particularly regarding cross-border data transfer restrictions.
  - **Multi-Region Distribution**: Data is distributed and stored across multiple legal jurisdictions to mitigate risks from localized regulatory changes.

- **Client Declaration**:
  - Clients must sign a data compliance declaration confirming that their data sources are lawful and comply with local regulations.
  - The purpose of data storage must be clearly stated and cannot involve illegal activities or regulatory circumvention.

- **Data Sampling and Verification**:
  - Clients must provide a sample dataset (≥20% of requested DataCap) for verification.
  - We verify data authenticity and completeness through sampling, content comparison, and analysis.
  - Automated tools (e.g., datacapstats.io, CID Checker, AC Bot) are combined with manual checks to enhance verification efficiency and accuracy.

- **Auditable Evidence for Governance**:
  - Comprehensive KYC/KYB reports for each client.
  - CID sampling logs and download proofs using Lotus tools.
  - Deal proofs, including verified dealIDs, pieceCIDs, data sizes, and sealing status.
  - Historical client behavior and DataCap usage records.
  - Geographic and industry metadata for each client and deal.

All evidence is periodically published (with sensitive data redacted) in our GitHub bookkeeping repository: [https://github.com/HBCrop/GOME-Filplus](https://github.com/HBCrop/GOME-Filplus).

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

To protect our organization, reputation, and pathway from abuse, GOME Fil+ employs the following strategies:

- **Operational Security (OpSec)**:
  - Utilization of third-party KYC/KYB providers (e.g., Toggle) for secure identity verification.
  - Encryption and secure storage of sensitive client data, used solely for verification purposes.
- **Risk Alert System**:
  - Automated monitoring of abnormal storage behavior, such as excessive replication or suspicious deal patterns.
  - Daily review of geographic distribution of deals and storage provider (SP) concentration.
- **Violation Handling**:
  - Enforcement measures for non-compliant clients, including freezing, downgrading, or revoking storage authorization.
  - Detailed records of violation incidents are maintained for governance audits.
- **User Agreements**:
  - Clients must sign a data compliance declaration agreeing to lawful data usage and adherence to program requirements.

## Dispute Resolutions

Disputes related to DataCap allocation, data compliance, or storage deals are handled as follows:

- **Internal Disputes (between GOME Fil+ and clients)**:
  - Clients are notified of discrepancies or issues (e.g., non-compliant data, deal execution failures).
  - A resolution period is provided, supported by clear communication via email or Slack.
  - If unresolved, DataCap may be suspended or reclaimed, with detailed records provided for transparency.
- **External Disputes (with other allocators or Fil+ Governance Team)**:
  - We provide comprehensive evidence, including KYC/KYB reports, CID sampling logs, deal proofs, and client behavior records, to defend our decisions.
  - Disputes are escalated to the Filecoin Governance Team with full transparency and cooperation.
- **Documentation**: All dispute-related communications and resolutions are logged and maintained for audit purposes.

## Compliance Audit Check

To ensure compliance with Filecoin Plus program-wide and pathway-specific requirements:

- **Client Compliance**:
  - Regular KYC/KYB reviews and data sampling (≥20% of DataCap) to verify data ownership and legality.
  - Clients must sign compliance declarations confirming lawful data sources and usage.
- **Storage Provider (SP) Compliance**:
  - Daily automated reviews of SP concentration and deal patterns using tools like datacapstats.io and CID Checker.
  - Suspicious SP behavior triggers internal investigations and potential deal restrictions.
- **Audit Preparedness**:
  - We maintain detailed records of KYC/KYB reports, CID sampling logs, deal proofs, and client metadata.
  - These records are periodically published (with sensitive data redacted) in our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/HBCrop/GOME-Filplus](https://github.com/HBCrop/GOME-Filplus).
  - Periodic compliance reviews ensure ongoing adherence to program requirements.
