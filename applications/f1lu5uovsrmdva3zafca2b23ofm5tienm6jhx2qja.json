    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology (CCIC) is a novel, deep-learning-based climate record of ice-particle concentrations in the atmosphere. CCIC results are available at high spatial and temporal resolution (0.07째 / 3 h from 1983, 0.036째 / 30 min from 2000) and thus ideally suited for evaluating high-resolution weather and climate models or studying individual weather systems.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology (CCIC) is a novel, deep-learning-based climate record of ice-particle concentrations in the atmosphere. CCIC results are available at high spatial and temporal resolution (0.07째 / 3 h from 1983, 0.036째 / 30 min from 2000) and thus ideally suited for evaluating high-resolution weather and climate models or studying individual weather systems.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "First, I downloaded the dataset from aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://chalmerscloudiceclimatology/ and categorized it by collection. I then created different directories to categorize the files and packaged them into car files ranging in size from 20GB to 32GB. I then distributed them to the SP via HTTP for storage.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://chalmerscloudiceclimatology 262.7213 TiB",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "North America, South America, Europe, Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03289271 Germany\nf03315260 Germany\nf03367915 United States\nf03542777 Vietnam\nf03603117 United States\nf03559187 United States\nf03100006 HongKong\nf03100007 HongKong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
